# Homework_01

**Overview**  

The task for this project was to attempt a code refactoring for the University of Texas- Houston Coding Boot Camp. Elements were altered to improve the developer and user experience.  

**Features** 

* The div tags in the original code were changed to semantic tags (like nav, section, etc.) in both HTML and CSS.   
* Images were given descriptive alt attributes to increase accessibility.   
* The title element was given a descriptive name.  
* The heading attributes were changed to fit in sequential order.   
* Proper spacing was used to organize and make reading easier.   
* The appropriate semantic tags were used in the structure of the code.   
* The program works and looks the same as before even with the changes in the code.
